Madeline is an emerging museum professional specializing in collections, registration, curation, and education. 

I recently completed my Master of Arts in Anthropology with a concentration in Museum and Heritage Studies at the University of Denver. My master's thesis, Queer is Here, Hopefully to Stay: The Incorporation and Reception of LGBTQ+ History at The History Colorado Center, used a critical museology, queer theory, and intersectional lens to explore the incorporation, development, and reception of LGBTQ+ history at History Colorado by employing museum ethnography and audience research and evaluation. I currently work as a Registration Assistant at the Denver Art Museum. In this role, I work closely with the Traveling Exhibits and Loan Registrars to ensure objects are correctly cataloged and ready for display or travel. In my career, I strive to make museum collections and exhibitions inclusive and accessible for underrepresented populations.
